  "notes": "2026-01-21 07:50 - Iteration 1 [9rk]: Created internal/calculator/calc.go with Add function. Package follows existing patterns with doc comment. Build passes. Next task should add Subtract and Multiply to the same file.\n2026-01-21 07:51 - Iteration 2 [rvs]: Added Subtract and Multiply functions to internal/calculator/calc.go. All three arithmetic functions now available (Add, Subtract, Multiply). Build passes. Next task should add tests for all three functions.\n2026-01-21 07:51 - Iteration 3 [zan]: Created internal/calculator/calc_test.go with table-driven tests for all three functions. 9 test cases total (3 per function). All tests pass. Next task should clean up by removing the calculator package.",
