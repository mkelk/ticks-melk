  "closed_reason": "Verified implementation of --awaiting filter on list command was already complete: optionalString flag type with empty-value (all awaiting) and specific value (comma-separated types) support. Added comprehensive tests for all filter behaviors: empty value filters all awaiting ticks, specific type filtering, comma-separated multiple types, backwards compat with Manual=true ticks (maps to awaiting=work), and combination with other filters.",
