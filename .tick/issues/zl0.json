  "description": "Several places in the codebase still reference 'main' branch in comments, help text, and user-facing messages, when they should reference the dynamic target branch (ParentBranch or main fallback).",
  "notes": "2026-01-24 15:07 - Completed [rgn]: ConflictState now has TargetBranch field and ConflictInfo() uses it. HandleConflict signature changed to include targetBranch param - any future callers will need to pass MergeResult.TargetBranch.\n2026-01-24 15:10 - Completed [4ex]: Updated merge command help text (Short and Long) to reference 'target branch' instead of hardcoded 'main', and explained that worktrees created from feature branches merge back to their ParentBranch.",
