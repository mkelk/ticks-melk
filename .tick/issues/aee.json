  "description": "Add three new fields to tick schema:\n- requires: Pre-declared gate (approval|review|content) set at creation, persists through lifecycle\n- awaiting: Current wait state (work|approval|input|review|content|escalation|checkpoint), transient\n- verdict: Human response (approved|rejected), transient, triggers state processing\n\nThese fields implement the agent-human handoff state machine.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 17:26 - Completed pgg: Added Requires field to Tick struct. Field is *string with json:requires,omitempty tag. Valid values are 'approval', 'review', 'content' (defined as RequiresApproval/RequiresReview/RequiresContent constants). Validation added to Validate() method with isRequiresValid() helper. Tests added. Pattern follows existing enum validation (isStatusValid, isTypeValid).\n2026-01-14 17:28 - Completed 5v7: Added Awaiting field to Tick struct. Field is *string with json:awaiting,omitempty tag. Valid values are work, approval, input, review, content, escalation, checkpoint (defined as AwaitingWork/AwaitingApproval/etc constants). Validation added to Validate() method with isAwaitingValid() helper. Tests added. Pattern follows existing enum validation (isStatusValid, isTypeValid, isRequiresValid).\n2026-01-14 17:30 - Completed d2f: Added Verdict field to Tick struct. Field is *string with json:verdict,omitempty tag. Valid values are 'approved', 'rejected' (defined as VerdictApproved/VerdictRejected constants). Validation added to Validate() method with isVerdictValid() helper. Tests added. Pattern follows existing enum validation (isStatusValid, isTypeValid, isRequiresValid, isAwaitingValid). All three schema fields for agent-human handoff are now complete: Requires, Awaiting, Verdict.\n2026-01-14 17:31 - Completed c91: Added ValidRequiresValues, ValidAwaitingValues, ValidVerdictValues slices to tick.go (lines 50-55). Constants already existed from previous iterations (pgg, 5v7, d2f). Added TestValidValueSlices test. All workflow enum constants and slices are now complete in internal/tick/tick.go.\n2026-01-14 17:33 - Completed bet: Added 4 workflow helper methods to Tick struct (lines 178-212 in tick.go). IsAwaitingHuman() checks Awaiting\\!=nil OR Manual flag. GetAwaitingType() returns awaiting value or 'work' for Manual=true. HasRequiredGate() returns Requires\\!=nil. IsTerminalAwaiting() uses GetAwaitingType() and returns true for approval/review/content/work (non-terminal: input/escalation/checkpoint). Tests added. All methods use pointer receiver (*Tick) for consistency.\n2026-01-14 17:34 - Completed rhd: Added TestWorkflowFieldsJSONSerialization test in tick_test.go. Test covers JSON round-trip for all workflow fields (requires, awaiting, verdict), omitempty behavior, parsing from raw JSON, backwards compat without workflow fields, and coexistence with legacy Manual flag. All 3 test categories from task spec are now complete: validation tests (TestTickValidateRequires/Awaiting/Verdict), serialization tests (TestWorkflowFieldsJSONSerialization), helper method tests (TestIsAwaitingHuman/GetAwaitingType/HasRequiredGate/IsTerminalAwaiting). Epic schema changes complete.",
