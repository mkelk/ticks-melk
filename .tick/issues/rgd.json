  "closed_reason": "Added mobile touch interactions: (1) CSS @media (pointer: coarse) rules ensure 44px min touch targets for all interactive elements, (2) Touch-friendly drag-and-drop with long-press to initiate (300ms), visual ghost element, and drop zone indicators - supports moving cards to Done (close) or from Done (reopen), (3) Enhanced tablet swipe navigation with scroll-snap-type:x mandatory for smooth column swiping. Key files: style.css (touch target CSS, drag/drop styles), app.js (touch event handlers, drag state management).",
