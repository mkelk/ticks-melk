  "closed_reason": "Added --include-awaiting flag to tk ready command. Implemented ReadyIncludeAwaiting() in query package. Deprecated --include-manual flag with warning. Removed redundant manual filtering since Ready() now uses IsAwaitingHuman(). Added tests for both query and CLI.",

  "description": "Update tk ready command to exclude awaiting ticks\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- Shows all ready tasks (not blocked)\n- Has --include-manual flag to optionally show manual tasks\n\nNew behavior:\n- Exclude awaiting ticks by default (like manual)\n- Add --include-awaiting flag for optional display\n- Consider renaming/generalizing to --include-human or similar\n\nThe tk ready command shows agent-workable tasks. Tasks awaiting human should not appear by default since they're not actionable by agent.\n\nImplementation options:\n1. Reuse Ready() which now excludes awaiting (simplest)\n2. Add explicit filter in ready command\n3. Add --include-awaiting flag for humans wanting to see all\n\nRecommendation: Use Ready() and add --include-awaiting flag that bypasses the awaiting filter.",
