  "closed_reason": "Added CSS styling for sl-alert::part(close-button) to ensure visibility in dark theme. The closable attribute was already present, but the close button was invisible due to missing color styling against the Catppuccin dark background. Added base color (--subtext0) and hover color (--text) for the close button.",
