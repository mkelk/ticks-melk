User clicks on completed tick\n2. Drawer opens with Details tab selected (current behavior)\n3. Run tab visible, clicking it shows run-record component\n4. Loading state while fetching from API\n\nRun: npm test -- --grep 'tick-detail-drawer'",

  "closed_reason": "Added Run tab to tick-detail-drawer.ts using sl-tab-group. The Run tab is only shown for closed tasks and displays run record data via the run-record component. Modified render() to use tabs with Details and Run panels, added renderDetailsContent() and renderRunTab() methods, added shouldShowRunTab() helper, and appropriate CSS for tab styling."
