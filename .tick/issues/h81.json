  "closed_reason": "Implemented mobile column tabs UI for switching between columns instead of vertical stacking. Added tab bar with column icons, labels, and counts that appears at \u003c480px breakpoint. Only one column is visible at a time, with full-screen height for card scrolling. Tabs are color-coded per column type and show real-time counts.",
