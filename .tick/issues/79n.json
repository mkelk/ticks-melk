  "closed_reason": "Wired tick-board.ts with API data: 1) Added fetchTicks/fetchInfo calls in connectedCallback with loading/error states; 2) Columns already computed by server via tick.column field; 3) Implemented getFilteredTicks() for search (ID/title/description) and epic (parent) filtering; 4) Replaced inline header with tick-header component, columns with tick-column components; 5) Event handlers for search-change, epic-filter-change, tick-selected; 6) Build passes, TypeScript compiles cleanly",

  "description": "Update tick-board.ts to:\n1. Fetch ticks on connectedCallback using fetchTicks()\n2. Group ticks into columns by status:\n   - blocked: ticks with blockers\n   - ready: open ticks without blockers, not in progress\n   - in-progress: ticks with 'in-progress' label or status\n   - review: ticks awaiting review\n   - done: closed ticks\n3. Apply search filter (title, description match)\n4. Apply epic filter (parent matches selected epic)\n5. Render 5 tick-column components with filtered ticks\n6. Handle tick-selected event to set selected tick\n7. Handle header events for search/filter changes\n\nTest: Load board with real API, verify ticks appear in correct columns",
