  "description": "Implement the enhanced help text format from AGENT_HUMAN_WORKFLOW.md\n\nCurrent help is just flag definitions. The design doc proposes:\n\n1. USAGE section showing command signature\n2. FLAGS section with grouped flags and multi-line descriptions  \n3. DESCRIPTION section explaining behavior\n4. EXAMPLES section with practical usage\n\nExample format for tk create:\n```\ntk create - Create a new tick\n\nUSAGE:\n    tk create \u003ctitle\u003e [flags]\n\nFLAGS:\n    -d, --description string   Tick description\n    --requires string          Pre-declared approval gate: approval, review, content\n                               Tick will route to human after agent completes\n    --awaiting string          Immediate human assignment: work, approval, ...\n                               Tick will be skipped by agent until human responds\n\nEXAMPLES:\n    tk create \"Fix login bug\" -d \"Users can't login\"\n    tk create \"Update auth flow\" --requires approval\n```\n\nCommands needing enhanced help:\n- create (with --requires, --awaiting)\n- approve\n- reject  \n- list (with --awaiting filter)\n- next (with --awaiting flag)\n- note (with --from flag)\n\nImplementation approach:\n- Override FlagSet.Usage to provide custom formatting\n- Or create help subcommand that outputs formatted help",
