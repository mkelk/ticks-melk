  "description": "Enhance tickboard to display rich run information from agent execution. Two main features:\n\n1. **Run Summary Tab** - In the tick detail drawer, add a 'Run' tab showing the RunRecord for completed ticks (output, thinking, tools used, metrics, verification status)\n\n2. **Live Output Panel Tabs** - Enhance the live output panel to have tabs for:\n   - Streaming output (existing functionality)\n   - Context document (markdown rendered from .tick/logs/context/\u003cepic-id\u003e.md)\n\nData sources:\n- RunRecord via /api/records/:tickId\n- Context docs at .tick/logs/context/\u003cepic-id\u003e.md\n- SSE streaming via /api/run-stream/:epicId\n\nUI patterns: Lit components, Shoelace UI library, collapsible sections",
  "notes": "2026-01-20 21:59 - Completed [64h]: Added /api/context/:epicId endpoint. Pattern follows existing handlers in server.go - path parsing, method validation, file read from .tick/logs/context/\u003cepicId\u003e.md. Tests use ports 18821-18824 (continuing sequence from existing tests). Content-Type is 'text/markdown; charset=utf-8'.\n2026-01-20 22:03 - Completed [l1e]: Created run-record.ts Lit component with collapsible sl-details sections for displaying RunRecord data. Component has Summary (model, session, status, duration), Metrics (tokens, cost), Output (collapsible), Thinking (collapsible), Tools (collapsible list), and Verification (collapsible) sections. Added sl-details Shoelace component import to main.ts. Follows existing patterns from tick-detail-drawer.ts. Uses Catppuccin Mocha theme colors.\n2026-01-20 22:07 - Completed [owj]: Added Run tab to tick-detail-drawer. Uses sl-tab-group with Details and Run tabs. Run tab only shown for closed tasks (shouldShowRunTab() checks tick.type === 'task' \u0026\u0026 tick.status === 'closed'). Uses the run-record component created in l1e iteration. The old inline renderRunHistory() and renderVerification() methods are still in the code but no longer used in the main details view - the run-record component handles all that now.\n2026-01-20 22:11 - Completed [sgv]: Created context-pane.ts component using marked library (v17) for markdown parsing. Component fetches from /api/context/:epicId, handles loading/empty/error states, and auto-refreshes when epicId changes. Styled markdown with Catppuccin Mocha colors - headers use mauve/lavender/blue, code blocks use mantle bg with peach for inline code, blockquotes have mauve border. Added fetchContext() to api/ticks.ts. The tickboard UI doesn't have npm tests configured - verified with vite build instead.\n2026-01-20 22:11 - Iteration 4: Verification failed for task sgv. [git] M internal/tickboard/ui/node_modules/.pnpm/lock.yaml | ?? internal/tickboard/ui/node_modules/.bin/marked | ?? internal/tickboard/ui/node_modules/.pnpm/marked@17.0.1/ | ?? internal/tickboard/ui/node_modules/marked Please fix and close the task again.\n2026-01-20 22:13 - Completed [sgv]: Fixed verification failure by committing the marked library node_modules files. This project tracks node_modules in git (unusual but intentional), so new npm dependencies must be committed. The context-pane component itself was already complete from iteration 4.\n2026-01-20 22:15 - Completed [am0]: Added Output/Context tabs to run-output-pane. Tab preference stored in localStorage key 'run-output-pane-active-tab'. Context tab uses context-pane component created in sgv iteration. Header actions (auto-scroll, copy, clear) conditionally render for Output tab only. Tab styling follows tick-detail-drawer patterns. Build verified with vite build.\n2026-01-20 22:15 - Iteration 6: Verification failed for task am0. [git] D internal/tickboard/server/static/assets/app-GKsOYQbz.js | M internal/tickboard/server/static/index.html | ?? internal/tickboard/server/static/assets/app-DzPzCnIu.js Please fix and close the task again.\n2026-01-20 22:16 - Completed [am0]: Fixed verification failure - committed static assets (app-DzPzCnIu.js, index.html) that were built but not staged in iteration 6. This project tracks built static assets in git (internal/tickboard/server/static/), so after any UI change you must run 'vite build' in the ui/ directory AND commit the regenerated files in server/static/.",
