  "description": "Add filter capability in the TUI (tk view) for awaiting status\n\nShould support:\n- Filter to show only awaiting tasks (human queue)\n- Filter to show only non-awaiting tasks (agent queue)\n- Filter by specific awaiting type (approval, review, etc.)\n\nPossible UX:\n- 'h' key to toggle 'human tasks only' filter\n- 'H' key (shift) to cycle through awaiting types\n- Status bar shows current filter\n\nThis complements the existing filters (owner, labels, search) to help humans manage their review queue.",

Implemented applyAwaitingFilter(), updated buildItems() pipeline, added status bar indicators, and created unit tests. Files: internal/tui/model.go, internal/tui/model_test.go"
