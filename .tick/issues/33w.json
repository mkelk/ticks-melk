  "notes": "2026-01-16 22:17 - Completed [dye]: Added base responsive styles. Key changes: viewport-fit=cover for notched devices, overflow-x:hidden on html/body, safe-area-inset support via CSS env(), responsive header with flex-wrap at 768px/480px breakpoints. Existing 480px media query enhanced with touch target sizing (min 44px). Toast container now uses safe area insets. The search/filter inputs grow flexibly on mobile. Repo name hidden on very small screens to save space.\n2026-01-16 22:20 - Completed [h81]: Responsive kanban layout implemented. Key breakpoints: (1) Mobile \u003c480px stacks columns vertically with scrollable column content (max-height 300px), (2) Tablet 481-768px uses horizontal scroll with fixed 260px columns and scroll-snap. Used CSS-only approach - no JS changes needed. The :has() selector is used for empty column detection (modern browser support). Previous iteration's base responsive work (viewport-fit, safe-area-insets) was leveraged.\n2026-01-16 22:22 - Completed [rgd]: Added mobile touch interactions. Key implementation details: (1) Touch targets use @media (pointer: coarse) to apply 44px minimum sizing only on touch devices - keeps desktop UI unchanged. (2) Drag-and-drop uses long-press (300ms) to differentiate from scroll gestures - the startTouchDrag function creates a ghost element and placeholder. (3) Only Done column transitions are supported via drag (close/reopen) since other columns are determined by tick properties not direct moves. (4) Swipe navigation relies on CSS scroll-snap-type:x mandatory - browser handles the physics. (5) The touch drag handlers are re-attached when cards re-render via renderTicks override pattern.\n2026-01-16 22:26 - Completed [g7c]: Mobile navigation implemented. Key details: (1) Hamburger menu appears at 768px breakpoint via CSS media query - no JS needed for show/hide toggle button. (2) Mobile nav sidebar is 280px wide (max 85vw) with slide-in animation. (3) Mobile filter changes sync to desktop filters and vice-versa. (4) Search in mobile nav is live-updating (no close on type). Epic filter closes nav after selection for better UX. (5) z-index hierarchy: nav overlay 180, nav sidebar 190, modals 200+. (6) The header-center (search/filter) is hidden on mobile since it's in the sidebar.\n2026-01-16 22:29 - Completed [h81] (revisited): Replaced vertical column stacking with mobile column tabs. Human feedback suggested tabs would be better UX than vertical stacking. Key implementation: tab bar with 5 column buttons at \u003c480px, CSS-only column show/hide via .mobile-active class, JS handles tab switching and maintains state. Tabs show icons, short labels, and live counts. Color-coded per column type. Desktop unchanged - tabs hidden via display:none on larger screens.\n2026-01-16 22:33 - Completed [cfy]: Generated PWA icons and favicon set. Key implementation: (1) Icons generated using sharp-cli via npx for SVG-to-PNG conversion. (2) favicon.ico created with Node.js script embedding PNG data (ICO format). (3) All icons use Catppuccin Mocha colors (#1e1e2e background, #f5e0dc checkmark). (4) Maskable icons have smaller checkmark to fit within 80% safe zone. (5) manifest.json created with standard + maskable purpose icons. (6) index.html updated with full favicon stack, Apple PWA meta tags, and theme-color. Files: icon-192.png, icon-512.png, icon-maskable-192.png, icon-maskable-512.png, apple-touch-icon.png, favicon-16x16.png, favicon-32x32.png, favicon.ico, manifest.json, icon.svg, icon-maskable.svg.\n2026-01-16 22:33 - Iteration 6 error: agent run: parse stream output: bufio.Scanner: token too long\n2026-01-16 22:36 - Completed [vxc]: Added service worker for PWA offline support. Key implementation: (1) sw.js uses cache-first strategy for static assets (/static/*) with stale-while-revalidate pattern - returns cached response immediately but fetches update in background. (2) API calls skip service worker entirely to always hit network. (3) WebSocket and SSE connections are excluded from caching. (4) Fixed manifest.json icon paths to use absolute URLs (/static/...) for proper resolution. (5) Service worker registration in index.html happens on 'load' event. Cache version is 'tickboard-v1' - increment when deploying breaking changes.",
