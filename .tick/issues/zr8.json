  "description": "When writing awaiting state, clear the Manual field\n\nWhen setting Awaiting on a tick:\n- Clear Manual field to avoid confusion\n- Only use Awaiting field going forward\n\nImplementation:\nAdd method to tick.go:\n\nfunc (t *Tick) SetAwaiting(value string) {\n    if value == \"\" {\n        t.Awaiting = nil\n    } else {\n        t.Awaiting = \u0026value\n    }\n    t.Manual = false  // Clear old field\n}\n\nAll code setting awaiting should use this method or explicitly clear Manual.\n\nThis ensures:\n- New ticks use Awaiting, not Manual\n- Updated ticks migrate from Manual to Awaiting\n- No tick has both Manual=true and Awaiting set",
