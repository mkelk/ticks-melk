  "description": "Add new 'reject' command to cmd/tk/main.go\n\nUsage: tk reject \u003cid\u003e [feedback message]\n\nBehavior:\n1. Parse tick ID from positional argument\n2. Parse optional feedback message from remaining args\n3. Load the tick\n4. Verify tick has awaiting set (error if not awaiting human)\n5. If feedback provided, add as human note FIRST (before verdict processing)\n6. Set verdict = \"rejected\"\n7. Call verdict processing logic (triggers state transition)\n8. Save tick\n9. Output result\n\nImplementation pattern:\n- Add case \"reject\" to main switch\n- Create runReject(args []string, stdout, stderr io.Writer) int\n- Feedback message is joined from remaining positional args\n- Note added with --from human semantics (for agent context)\n\nIMPORTANT: Add note BEFORE processing verdict to prevent race condition where ticker picks up task before feedback is saved.\n\nError cases:\n- No ID provided (exit code 2)\n- Tick not found (exit code 4)\n- Tick not awaiting human (error message)",

    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding the existing implementation, then implement the `tk reject` command.\n\nLet me first read the current implementation of `tk approve` to understand the pattern:\n\nNow I have a clear understanding of the `runApprove` function. I can see the pattern to follow for implementing `runReject`. Let me also check the tick package to understand the Verdict and note handling:\n\nLet me also check the `ProcessVerdict` function to understand the verdict processing:\n\nNow I understand the full pattern. Let me look at how notes are added in `runNote` to understand the note format to use for human feedback:\n\nLooking at `runNote` (lines 914-1022), I can see notes are formatted with timestamps: `timestamp - note`. For the reject command with feedback, I need to add a human note following this pattern but marking it as from human for agent context.\n\nNow I have everything I need to implement the `runReject` function. Let me add it:\n\nNow let me add the `runReject` function after `runApprove`:\n\nNow let me update the help text to include the reject command:\n\nNow let me run the tests to make sure everything works:\n\nAll tests pass. Let me test the help output to make sure the reject command is properly integrated:\n\nLet me test the error cases:\n\nNow let me test with an existing tick that is not awaiting human:\n\nNow let me create a test tick with awaiting set to test the full flow:\n\nThe reject command works correctly:\n1. It returned to agent (not closed) because for `awaiting=work` state, rejection doesn't close the tick (only approval does)\n2. The feedback note was added with `[human]` attribution\n3. The verdict and awaiting fields were cleared\n\nLet me also test with JSON output and a tick that will be closed on rejection. First, let me create a tick with awaiting=input which should close on rejection:\n\nThe input rejection correctly closed the tick. Let me clean up the test ticks:\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me close the task:\n\nNow let me commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic:\n\nI've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**Task [xkr] - Implement tk reject command**\n\nAdded the `runReject()` function to `cmd/tk/main.go` following the same pattern as `runApprove()`:\n\n1. **Command parsing**: Uses `parseInterleaved` for FlagSet with `--json` flag and positional args\n2. **ID validation**: First positional arg is required tick ID, remaining args join into feedback message\n3. **Awaiting check**: Verifies tick has `awaiting` set or legacy `manual` flag\n4. **Backwards compatibility**: Converts legacy `manual=true` to `awaiting=work` before processing\n5. **Note ordering**: Adds feedback note with `[human]` prefix BEFORE calling `ProcessVerdict` to prevent race condition\n6. **State machine**: Uses `ProcessVerdict` which closes on rejection for `input`/`escalation` states, returns to agent otherwise\n7. **Output**: Standard output shows \"rejected \u003cid\u003e (closed|returned to agent)\", JSON includes tick and closed flag\n\nError cases properly handled:\n- No ID: exit code 2\n- Tick not found: exit code 4  \n- Tick not awaiting human: exit code 2 with helpful message",
