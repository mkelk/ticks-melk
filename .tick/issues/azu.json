  "closed_reason": "Implemented keyboard navigation in tick-board with vim-style shortcuts (j/k/h/l and arrow keys for navigation, Enter to open, Escape to close/clear, n for create, / to focus search, ? for help dialog). Added focusedColumnIndex and focusedTickIndex state tracking, keyboard event listener, and passed focused state to tick-column and tick-card components for visual highlighting (blue ring). Focused cards auto-scroll into view.",
