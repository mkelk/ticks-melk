  "description": "Implement collaborative workflow between AI agents (via ticker) and humans for task completion. This replaces the simple 'manual' boolean with a richer model where agents can hand off tasks to humans for specific reasons (approval, input, review, etc.) and humans can respond with structured verdicts.\n\nKey components:\n- Three new enum fields: requires, awaiting, verdict\n- New CLI commands: approve, reject\n- New CLI flags for create/update/list/next\n- Verdict processing state machine\n- Backwards compatibility with manual field\n\nReference: ../ticker/docs/AGENT_HUMAN_WORKFLOW.md",
