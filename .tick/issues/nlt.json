  "description": "Modify query.Ready() in internal/query/ready.go to exclude ticks with awaiting set\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- Returns open/in_progress ticks not blocked by open blockers\n- Respects defer_until dates\n- Excludes Manual=true (via separate --include-manual flag in CLI)\n\nNew behavior:\n- Also exclude ticks where Awaiting != null\n- Use tick.IsAwaitingHuman() helper for backwards compat with Manual\n\nThis is critical for ticker integration:\n- tk next uses Ready() to find agent-workable tasks\n- Tasks awaiting human response should NOT be returned\n- Agent should move on to other tasks while waiting for human\n\nImplementation:\nIn the Ready() filter loop, add check:\n  if t.IsAwaitingHuman() {\n      continue // Skip, waiting for human\n  }\n\nNote: The Manual field handling may already be in CLI layer (--include-manual). Need to consolidate with awaiting handling.",
