  "closed_reason": "Added tick-detail-drawer component to tick-board.ts template. The drawer was not being rendered even though selectedTick state existed. Added state for notes, blockers, and parent title. Modified handleTickSelected to fetch full tick details via fetchTick API and added handleDrawerClose to clear state.",
