  "notes": "2026-01-14 23:09 - Task lg7 requests \"Refactor database connection pooling\" but this codebase has no database infrastructure. The system is file-based by design (SPEC.md states \"No daemon, no SQLite, no background processes. Just files\"). Storage uses flat JSON files in .tick/issues/ with standard os.ReadFile/WriteFile operations. There is no database connection pooling code to refactor. Please clarify: (1) Is this a test task to verify the escalation workflow? (2) Should I close this as not applicable? (3) Is there different work intended?\n2026-01-14 22:17 - Work complete, awaiting review",
