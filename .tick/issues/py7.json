Task may be partially complete - review before continuing.\n2026-01-21 07:35 - Task yng (distinguish agent vs human actor): Fixed by setting TICK_OWNER=ticker env var in ClaudeAgent.Run() when spawning the claude CLI subprocess. This ensures all tk commands run by the agent inherit this env var and are properly attributed to 'ticker'. The activity feed UI already displays actor field as-is, so no UI changes needed.",
