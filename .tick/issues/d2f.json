  "description": "Add Verdict field to Tick struct in internal/tick/tick.go\n\nField specification:\n- Name: Verdict\n- Type: *string (pointer for optional/nullable)\n- JSON tag: json:\"verdict,omitempty\"\n- Valid values: null, \"approved\", \"rejected\"\n\nPurpose: Human's response to an awaiting state. This field is transient - it gets set by human, then processed immediately, then cleared. The processing logic (in verdict processing epic) determines whether to close the tick or return it to agent.\n\nVerdict meanings:\n- null: No response yet (default)\n- approved: Human accepts/approves\n- rejected: Human rejects, needs changes\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Add field after Awaiting field in struct\n- Add validation in Validate() method for valid enum values\n- Verdict should only be set when Awaiting is also set (semantic validation, not struct validation)",
