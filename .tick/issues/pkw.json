  "description": "Move tickboard into ticks as the tk board command. No standalone tickboard binary after this phase.",
  "notes": "2026-01-18 00:14 - Task 0gv complete: Created cmd/tk/cmd/board.go with full functionality from tickboard. The findTickDir function was also added to board.go (local to the command). Next tasks should: (1) migrate tests from cmd/tickboard/main_test.go to cmd/tk/cmd/board_test.go, (2) delete the standalone cmd/tickboard/ directory after verification. Note: tickboard server/cloud tests have pre-existing failures (undefined ColumnBacklog, ColumnReview) - not related to this migration.\n2026-01-18 00:16 - Task rgb verified complete - board routing was already done in task 0gv. All pieces in place: (1) main.go switch case includes 'board', (2) help text includes 'board', (3) ResetFlags() resets boardPort=3000. Next: migrate tests from cmd/tickboard/main_test.go to cmd/tk/cmd/board_test.go, then delete cmd/tickboard/.",
