  "notes": "2026-01-16 20:41 - Created DOMAIN_SETUP.md with comprehensive instructions for setting up tickboard.io domain. The Go client already has DefaultCloudURL = wss://tickboard.io/agent, so once the domain is configured in Cloudflare, everything will work. Manual steps needed: 1) Register/purchase domain, 2) Add to Cloudflare, 3) Configure DNS records, 4) Uncomment routes in wrangler.toml, 5) Deploy. Consider using Cloudflare's 'Custom Domains' feature for simpler setup.\n2026-01-16 20:52 - (from: human) just acquired tickboard.dev with cloudflare. can you set up with wrangler?\n2026-01-16 20:55 - (from: Peter Engelbrecht) Reopened",

  "closed_reason": "Configured tickboard.dev custom domain using Cloudflare Workers custom domains feature. Updated: 1) wrangler.toml with custom_domain routes for tickboard.dev and www.tickboard.dev, 2) Go client DefaultCloudURL from tickboard.io to tickboard.dev, 3) DOMAIN_SETUP.md documentation. Deployed worker successfully - DNS resolves to Cloudflare IPs (188.114.97.12/188.114.96.12) and health endpoint responds correctly."
