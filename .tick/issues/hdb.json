Updated: 1) wrangler.toml with custom_domain routes for tickboard.dev and www.tickboard.dev, 2) Go client DefaultCloudURL from tickboard.io to tickboard.dev, 3) DOMAIN_SETUP.md documentation. Deployed worker successfully - DNS resolves to Cloudflare IPs (188.114.97.12/188.114.96.12) and health endpoint responds correctly.",

  "notes": "2026-01-16 20:41 - Created DOMAIN_SETUP.md with comprehensive instructions for setting up tickboard.io domain. The Go client already has DefaultCloudURL = wss://tickboard.io/agent, so once the domain is configured in Cloudflare, everything will work. Manual steps needed: 1) Register/purchase domain, 2) Add to Cloudflare, 3) Configure DNS records, 4) Uncomment routes in wrangler.toml, 5) Deploy. Consider using Cloudflare's 'Custom Domains' feature for simpler setup.\n2026-01-16 20:52 - (from: human) just acquired tickboard.dev with cloudflare. can you set up with wrangler?\n2026-01-16 20:55 - (from: Peter Engelbrecht) Reopened\n2026-01-16 21:03 - Domain tickboard.dev is now live. Worker deployed with custom_domain feature which auto-manages DNS. Both tickboard.dev and www.tickboard.dev route to the worker. Updated ~/.tickboardrc locally to use new URL. Note: Some tests fail due to pre-existing issues (TestLoadConfig_NoToken doesn't account for existing config file, server tests reference undefined constants) - not caused by this change.",
