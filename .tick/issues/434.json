  "notes": "2026-01-11 15:09 - Completed 7us: List items now truncate to panel width. The buildListView() function now takes a width param and uses the existing truncate() helper. Content width is calculated as leftWidth - 4 to account for border and padding.\n2026-01-11 16:21 - Completed 1p3: Added renderStatus() helper with color-coded status symbols (○ gray open, ● blue in_progress, ✓ green closed). Status is now displayed in both list and detail views. Follows existing pattern from renderPriority().\n2026-01-11 16:26 - Completed xfd: Added renderType() helper with color coding (epic=purple, bug=red, feature=teal, task/chore=default). Follows same pattern as renderStatus() and renderPriority(). Type is displayed in detail view only (list view kept compact). All colors use Catppuccin Mocha palette.",
