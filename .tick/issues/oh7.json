  "closed_reason": "Removed rejected column from kanban board. Rejected ticks now return to 'ready' column so agents can retry with feedback. Changes: (1) Removed column from index.html, (2) Removed from app.js column mapping, (3) Removed CSS styles for rejected column, (4) Updated computeColumn() in server.go to skip rejected check, (5) Added visual indicator (maroon border + badge) on cards with rejected verdict, (6) Updated test to expect ColumnReady for rejected+open ticks.",

  "description": "Rejected ticks should return to agent queue, not sit in a separate column:\n- Remove 'Rejected' column from index.html\n- Remove rejected column from app.js column mapping\n- Remove rejected column styles from style.css\n- Update getColumn() in server.go: rejected+open returns 'ready' not 'rejected'\n- Add visual indicator on card when tick has rejected verdict (e.g., small badge or border)\n- Rejected feedback should be visible in notes\n\nThis aligns with the flow: human rejects -\u003e agent sees feedback in notes -\u003e agent retries",
