  "closed_reason": "Fixed by incrementing service worker cache version from v2 to v3 in sw.js. The root cause was that the PWA service worker was caching old index.html with stale-while-revalidate strategy, which referenced asset hashes that no longer exist. Browsers with the cached service worker were requesting old assets like app-CzImBuAL.js instead of the current app-DtfuvxJt.js. The cache version increment triggers the activate event which clears old caches and forces fresh asset fetches.",
