  "description": "Add a first-class project field to ticks for grouping tasks/epics by project code. Enables filtering, querying, and tracking work across projects.\n\nSpec: docs/2026-01-14-5464-project-dim/SPEC.md",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 19:54 - Iteration 1 complete: Environment validated. Build passes, all 7 test packages pass. Key packages for project field implementation: internal/tick (tick data model), internal/query (filtering/querying), cmd/tk (CLI commands). No test files exist for internal/tui and internal/update.\n2026-01-14 19:55 - Iteration 1 complete: Build and tests verified. All 7 test packages pass. Key files to modify per SPEC.md: internal/tick/tick.go (add Project field), cmd/create.go, cmd/update.go, cmd/list.go, cmd/ready.go, cmd/next.go, cmd/show.go. No migration needed - missing field defaults to empty string (Go zero value).\n2026-01-14 19:57 - Iteration 2 complete: Added Project field to Tick struct (internal/tick/tick.go:39). Field is optional string with json:\"project,omitempty\" tag. Tests added for JSON serialization. Build and all 7 test packages pass. Next tasks should add --project flag to CLI commands (create, update, list, ready, next, show).\n2026-01-14 20:01 - Iteration 3 complete: Added -project flag to tk create (cmd/tk/main.go:312). Inheritance logic: explicit flag \u003e inherit from parent \u003e empty. Tests in TestCreateProjectFlag cover all 4 cases. Next tasks: update command, list filter, ready filter, next filter, show display.\n2026-01-14 20:04 - Iteration 4 complete: Added --project flag to tk update (cmd/tk/main.go:647-750). Used optionalString pattern for set/clear semantics. Test in TestUpdateProjectFlag covers set, change, and clear. Next tasks: list filter, ready filter, next filter, show display.\n2026-01-14 20:09 - Iteration 5 complete: Added --project filter to tk list (cmd/tk/main.go:1100, internal/query/filter.go). Project field added to Filter struct. Tests added in filter_test.go and main_test.go (TestListProjectFilter). Next tasks: ready filter, next filter, show display.",
