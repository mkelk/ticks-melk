  "closed_reason": "Added action buttons (Approve, Reject, Close, Reopen) to tick-detail-drawer component. Buttons conditionally render based on tick state: Approve/Reject for awaiting ticks, Close for open ticks without requires gate, Reopen for closed ticks. Reject/Close show textarea for reason input. Loading states disable buttons during API calls. Error messages display in sl-alert. Component emits tick-updated event with BoardTick on success. State resets on drawer close or tick change.",

  "description": "Add action buttons to tick-detail-drawer for tick state changes:\n\nAction buttons (sl-button with appropriate variants):\n- Approve: For ticks awaiting approval (calls approve endpoint)\n- Reject: For ticks awaiting approval (shows reason input, calls reject endpoint)\n- Close: For open ticks (shows reason input, calls closeTick API)\n- Reopen: For closed ticks (calls reopen endpoint)\n\nImplementation:\n1. Show only relevant actions based on tick state\n2. Reject/Close buttons show sl-input for reason before confirming\n3. Call appropriate API endpoints\n4. Emit 'tick-updated' event with updated tick\n5. Show loading state during API calls\n6. Show error toast on failure\n\nTest: Click each action, verify API called, tick updates in UI",
