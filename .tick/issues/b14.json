Show only relevant actions based on tick state\n2. Reject/Close buttons show sl-input for reason before confirming\n3. Call appropriate API endpoints\n4. Emit 'tick-updated' event with updated tick\n5. Show loading state during API calls\n6. Show error toast on failure\n\nTest: Click each action, verify API called, tick updates in UI",
