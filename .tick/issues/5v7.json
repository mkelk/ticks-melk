  "closed_reason": "Added Awaiting field to Tick struct. Field is *string with json:awaiting,omitempty tag. Valid values are work, approval, input, review, content, escalation, checkpoint (defined as AwaitingWork/AwaitingApproval/etc constants). Validation added to Validate() method with isAwaitingValid() helper. Tests added in TestTickValidateAwaiting. Pattern follows existing enum validation (Requires field).",

  "description": "Add Awaiting field to Tick struct in internal/tick/tick.go\n\nField specification:\n- Name: Awaiting\n- Type: *string (pointer for optional/nullable)\n- JSON tag: json:\"awaiting,omitempty\"\n- Valid values: null, \"work\", \"approval\", \"input\", \"review\", \"content\", \"escalation\", \"checkpoint\"\n\nPurpose: Indicates the tick is waiting for human action. Null means agent's turn (default), any other value means human's turn. This field is transient - it gets set/cleared as tasks move between agent and human.\n\nAwaiting value meanings:\n- work: Human must complete the task itself\n- approval: Agent done, needs human sign-off\n- input: Agent needs information from human\n- review: PR needs code review\n- content: UI/copy needs human judgment\n- escalation: Agent found issue, needs direction\n- checkpoint: Phase complete, verify before next\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Add field after Requires field in struct\n- Add validation in Validate() method for valid enum values\n- This replaces the semantics of the Manual field (awaiting=work ≈ manual=true)",
