  "notes": "2026-01-14 17:45 - Completed tk approve command [mld]. Key implementation details: (1) Added runApprove() following existing command patterns (FlagSet, parseInterleaved, etc.), (2) Manual flag backwards compatibility: when Awaiting is nil but Manual is true, we set Awaiting=work before calling ProcessVerdict, (3) ProcessVerdict handles the state machine - approve closes terminal states (work, approval, review, content) and returns to agent for non-terminal states (checkpoint, input, escalation), (4) JSON output includes both the tick and whether it was closed. Next task [boh] should follow same pattern for tk reject command, which also needs to accept optional feedback as positional arg.\n2026-01-14 17:49 - Completed tk reject [xkr]. Key pattern: feedback note added with [human] prefix BEFORE ProcessVerdict to prevent race condition where ticker picks up task before feedback is saved. Reject command mirrors approve command structure. Both commands now available for human verdict workflow.",
