Approve tick awaiting review → tick closes\n3. Approve tick awaiting content → tick closes\n4. Approve tick awaiting work → tick closes\n5. Approve tick awaiting input → tick returns to agent (not closed)\n6. Approve tick awaiting escalation → tick returns to agent\n7. Approve tick awaiting checkpoint → tick returns to agent\n8. Approve tick not awaiting → error\n9. Approve non-existent tick → error (exit 4)\n10. Approve with --json → JSON output\n\nTest cases for tk reject:\n1. Reject tick awaiting approval → tick returns to agent\n2. Reject tick awaiting input → tick closes (can't proceed)\n3. Reject tick awaiting escalation → tick closes (won't do)\n4. Reject with feedback → note added before state change\n5. Reject tick not awaiting → error\n6. Reject with --json → JSON output\n\nFollow existing test patterns (temp dir, create tick, run command, verify state).",
