  "closed_reason": "Added handler for 'registered' message type in cloud client. The server sends back 'registered' after successful registration, but the client's handleMessages switch statement had no case for it, causing it to fall through to the default unknown message type warning. Simple fix: added a case for 'registered' that does nothing (no action needed).",
