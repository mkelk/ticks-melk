Endpoint validates tick is awaiting human, sets verdict to approved, calls ProcessVerdict, saves the tick, and returns updated tick JSON with computed fields (isBlocked, column, closed). Handles legacy Manual flag by converting to AwaitingWork. Added 6 tests covering terminal/non-terminal states, validation, 404, method not allowed, and legacy manual support.",
