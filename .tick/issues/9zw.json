  "closed_reason": "Added slot=\"prefix\" to bell icon sl-icon element in tick-activity-feed.ts:342. Also fixed the refresh button icon at line 355 for consistency. This follows the Shoelace pattern where icons inside sl-button elements need the slot attribute to render correctly, especially when nested within dropdown triggers.",
