Frontend adds remove button on board items (appears on hover, turns red) with confirmation dialog. Board list refreshes after removal. Non-destructive - boards can reconnect later.",

  "notes": "2026-01-16 20:50 - Implemented board removal feature. Key points: (1) DELETE endpoint validates user ownership before deleting, (2) Removal is non-destructive - agents can reconnect and re-register the board, (3) UI shows remove button only on hover to avoid accidental clicks, (4) Confirmation dialog warns user that board can reconnect later.",
