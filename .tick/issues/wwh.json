  "notes": "2026-01-16 20:39 - Fixed by adding secondary sort by tick ID in app.js renderTicks(). Root cause: LoadTicksParallel uses concurrent goroutines with non-deterministic completion order, and frontend only sorted by priority. Now sorts by priority first, then by ID for ties.

  "closed_reason": "Added secondary sort by tick ID in app.js to ensure stable ordering when priorities are equal. The issue was that LoadTicksParallel loads ticks concurrently with non-deterministic order, and the frontend sort only used priority which caused reordering for ticks with same priority."
